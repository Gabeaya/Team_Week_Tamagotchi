## Description <a id="description"></a>
Upon starting the game, an egg appears and the egg hatches revealing "Gozi" which is the ghost version of a Tamagotchi. The user is obligated to care for their Tamagotchi or the poor thing will die. The animations will show the "state" of Gozi and whether or not it is happy, tired, sad, etc and what actions need to be taken to bring all the specs up to 100% for Gozi. Currently there are four action an user can select: feed, nap, clean and playwith. Currently only the hunger function works.

## Known Bugs <a id="bugs"></a>
* The Instructions, Settings, and History tabs on the splash page are currently not implemented.
* Currently, only the fork and knife icon work to feed the Tamagatchi. The toilet paper icon, the cat sleeping icon and the controller icon, will switch animations when pushed, but don't actually interact with the Tamagatchi's hygeine, sleep, or boredom characterists. These features need to be implemented.
